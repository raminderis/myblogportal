*People of Kashmir*
   
   In the life's of all people who came from Kashmir, the river Jehlum remains constant. <br>
   For all who have been displaced from their homes, I hope we all find our homes and our lands soon. <br>
   Our kids find in time, what their ancestor lost with time. <br>
   My people have long suffered, the land of Kashmir has seen way too much.<br>
   Kashmir has to heal, and with it all its people.
